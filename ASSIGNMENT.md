# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
>I learned the library by starting with the solarCalc.js file and seeing how the objects and classes there were connected to the 
>moon.js and sun.js files. The README file was also helpful with many of the astronomic terms I was unfamiliar with. 


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Effective comments should make it so that non-technical users could look at the code and understand what differernt pieces of it do. 


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 4 hours


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Joel helped me install jsdoc globally. 


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I'm not sure if my example is exactly what the assignment is looking for. It didn't seem to make sense to call every single function in this case because 
> there were so many functions in this module that supported other functions. It was also difficult to find an appriorate module to comment, it would have 
> been helpful if we had practiced some of this commenting in class before this assignment.
